I created this github account as part of the requirements for a course that I am taking in R programming for statistical analysis.  I have never used github before now and I am excited to get started.  I have very little programming experience.  Most of my knowledge comes from a basic understanding of if-then statements and loops.  I have had two formal programming courses but they were both entry level.
